Zenbox
=====================

I'm Zenbox. "Lightweight" (as in feature-devoid) homepage replacement that allows you to store persistent notes as your default homepage.

Uses html5 local storage, so you better have a good browser. IE doesn't really get a look in. This isnt' really tested with anything but Firefox yet either. 

29/12/13 - Just noticed there's another project called zenbox on gh... name change soon. Also, Sublime text seems to have ruined all tabs in the project. Oops.
