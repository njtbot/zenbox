Zen note
===

I'm a lightweight notepad. Add me as your homepage for persistent note taking in-browser without any plugins or extensions.

Uses HTML5 local storage, so you better have a good browser. IE doesn't really get any support. This is only tested on Firefox.

Todo -     
Cloud integration (either through Dropbox or lightweight MongoDB etc.)  
Scrape and email all panes   
Rich text editing (hallo.js?)   
Procedural pane generation   
Custom width   
Toggle resize and drag
